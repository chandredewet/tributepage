<main id="tribute-info">
<p>Francis was born in the mid fifties in the Northern Cape as the eight child of her parents (with 4 more siblings to be born after her). Her father was a missions school principal and music teacher and her mother managed the household affairs. </p>
<p> As a child, she picked cotton with her mother along the Orange River, for extra money for her home. At the age of 8 the whole family moved to the Franschhoek, Western Cape where they had to move from their first home in Akademie Street due to Apartheid reclassification of the area. </p>
<p>In highschool, she also worked outside of scool, either clearing the onion fields or stomping grapes with her feet for extra money.
In her final year of school, she was honoured for coming in the top 100 "coloured" Mathematics learners which included her being placed in a newspaper article. </p>
<p>She managed to acquire a bursary to study at the University of the Western Cape and received her BA and later BED in Maths, despite studying in the tumultuous seventies, with riots and police chasing them on campus. In this time she has a holiday job at Rhodes Fruit Factory, wearing a scarf and cutting apricots with a sharp knife, to make her own pocket money to buy material and make her own clothes and dresses for campus life. She qualifies and starts as a Maths teacher at age 21, her first school being Modderdam High.</p> 
  
<p>She marries in 1978 and has her first child in 1980, however 5 months later, her husband passes away. It is at this stage that she moves to Kuils River where she still resides today. She continued to study, and teach. Met her second husband at the next highschool, and he adopted her daughter, and gave her another two beautiful daughters. They are still very much inlove today. </p>
  
<p>She taught until the birth of her third child, and then decided to change directions and become an estate agent. When she approached a local estate agent they dismissed her, but this woman had built up so much grit over the years, that she went back until they employed her. After a year or two, she began her own Estate agency which is still running today. 
</p>  
<p>In recent times, Francis has challenged herself with her sewing which over the years has been a dress for herself, here or there, but in the last few years, has raised the bar in making 2 matric ball dresses and 2 wedding dresses (the one is still in progress). She has also made several dresses for her daughter who models, which have occasionally gotten the daughter best dressed prize. </p>
  
<p>In conclusion, what the author learns or sees in the example of her mother, is never limiting oneself, and what do you do with the opportunities given to one. In Cape Town, many around do not dare dream, but Francis has constantly pushed, even assisted her children and many others around to go further than they would have on her own. Despite all the hardwork, she still has a youthful glow, an innocent spirit and easy laughter.
She is an unsung hero, who would prefer it be kept that way, but who cannot be grateful to have this one in a million mom. Of which I am not even half of her. </p>

<p>Further information of Francis will not be found online, but you can read more about the her broader family history, that she comes from, her great grandfather having emigrated from the UK.
